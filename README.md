# BossMachine

In this project I created an entire API to serve information to a Boss Machine, a unique management application for today’s most accomplished (evil) entrepreneurs. I created routes to manage ‘minions’, brilliant ‘million dollar ideas’, and to handle all the annoying meetings that keep getting added to your busy schedule.
